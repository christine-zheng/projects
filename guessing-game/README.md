# Guessing Game

- The user guesses a number between 1-100. 
- The app will respond and indicate if their guess is 'hot' or 'cold' based on how close the guess is to the number they are trying to guess. 
- If the number submitted is the winning number, the player wins! Otherwise, they are allowed to try again. The user has 5 guesses.
- The game will keep track of the user's previous guesses, and give the user a way to reset the game or get a hint.
